What is the greatest value of k for which y is a factor of x?\nLet's think step by step.\n[answer]: The number of trailing zeros in the decimal representation of n!, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, can be determined with this formula:\nn5+n52+n53+...+n5k, where k must be chosen such that 5k≤n\nx = 1*2*3....*25 = 25!\nNo. of trailing zeros in 25! = 25/5 + 25/5^2 = 6\n100^k = 10^2k → k = 6/2 = 3\nTherefore, the answer is k=3.\n\n[document]: For any positive integer n, prove that the sum of the cubes of the first n positive integers is equal to 3n(n+1)(2n+1).\n\nLet's think step by step.\n[answer]: For any positive integer n, prove that the sum of the cubes of the first n positive integers is equal to 3n(n+1)(2n+1).\nWe prove this by induction.\nFor n=1, the statement is true as 1^3=1, 2^3=8, 3^3=27, 4^3=64, 5^3=125, 6^3=189, 7^3=277, 8^3=399, 9^3=541, 10^3=711.\nAssume the statement is true for some positive integer k.\nThen, the sum of the cubes of the first k positive integers is equal to 3(1^3)+(2^3)+(3^3)+...+(k^3)=3k(k+1)(2k+1).\nNow, let's consider the sum of the cubes of the first (k+1) positive integers.\nThe first one is 1^3+2^3+...+(k+1)^3=1+8+27+...+(k+1).\nThe middle term is (k+1)^3, which we have already considered above.\nThe remaining terms are all odd numbers, so their product is equal to (-1)^(k+1)*(2^3*3^3*...*(2^k-1)^3).\nThe exponent of 2 in this factor is (k+1)+(k+1)*(k+1)/2+(k+1)*"

We also know that y should exceed x by 8.\nNow we can solve for x and y as follows:\ny - x = 8\ny = 71 - x + 8\ny = 78\nSubstituting y = 78, we get:\n71 = x + 78\n71x + 78 = 71\nx = 0\ny = 78\nTherefore, the smaller part is 0 and the larger part is 78."

What is x ?\nLet's think step by step.\n[answer]: it is a good Q to learn to pick up number properties in the given set, even if we do not get a Q on these line in actuals..\nwhen we see the sequence 4, 10, x, 46, and 94, we see that each succeeding number is some value more than twice the previous number..\n10=2*4+2..\nx=2*10+2 = 22..\nand so on..\nso next number= 22\nTherefore, the answer is 22.\n\n[document]: A school currently maintains a fixed number of students per class. If the ratio of students per class were to be increased by 1, 10 fewer classes would be run for a total of 120 students. What is the current ratio Q of students per class?\n\nAnother way to look at the problem...\nSince the total is 120, RATIO * CLASSES = R*C = 120.....(i)\nwe are looking where ratio increases by 1 and # of classes decreases by 10 = (R+1)(C-10) = RC+C-10R-10=120....(ii)\n(ii)-(i)....\nC=10R+10 = 10(R+1).......\nso # of classes has to be multiple of 10\nAS RC=120.... 10(R+1)*R = 120...................R(R+1) = 12..\nso 12 is a multiple of consecutive numbers ONLY 3 *4 fits in..... and R=3.\n\n### Response:\n[question]: A school currently maintains a fixed number of students per class.
