        "text": "Unlabelled: The Institute of Medicine (IOM) has recommended instituting clinical education reforms to ensure all health profession graduates acquire five core competencies; providing patient-centered care, working in interdisciplinary teams, employing evidence-based practice, applying quality improvement and utilizing informatics. The IOM has identified 28 specific skills associated with these competencies. This qualitative, exploratory study was conducted to begin to examine the extent to which physical therapy clinical instructors provide students with instruction the students perceived as promoting the acquisition of these skills.\n\nMethods: Two groups of physical therapy students enrolled in a 3-year DPT program (7 on a first-year clinical education experience and 17 on a final year experience) maintained journals describing the types of learning activities used by clinical instructors to promote the acquisition of the competencies. The authors employed NVivo qualitative data analysis software to code the journal entries using 28 codes derived from the skills associated with the five core competencies.\n\nResults: Of the 327 coded learning activities, just over 50% were related to skills associated with providing patient-centered care (21.4%) and working in interdisciplinary teams (30.0%). The remaining 49.6% of the learning activities cited by students were related to skills associated with employing evidence-based practice (18.3%), applying quality improvement (16.5%) and utilizing informatics (13.8%).\n\nDiscussion: Based on student perceptions, physical therapy clinical instructors are providing learning activities that allow students to acquire skills associated with all five of the IOM competencies. However, students reported the least emphasis on instruction pertaining to the competencies of applying quality improvement and utilizing informatics.",
        "title_question": "Are physical therapy clinical instructors teaching the Institute of Medicine core competencies?",
        "long_answer": "This study supports the need for the profession of physical therapy to delineate formal and explicit clinical education instructional content and strategies to promote students' acquisition of the IOM core competency skills."

        "text": "Background: Preterm infants have reduced liver stores of vitamin A at birth compared to term born infants. Current guidelines recommend an intake of 700-1500 IU/kg/day vitamin A, and there is evidence to support higher doses for infants with significant lung disease. The importance of appropriate early nutrition for preterm infants is increasingly becoming apparent.\n\nObjectives: To examine whether preterm infants admitted to a UK neonatal unit received the currently recommended amounts of vitamin A during the first 4 weeks of life, and to identify the feeding patterns associated with optimal vitamin A intake.\n\nDesign: Retrospective case note review.\n\nSetting: UK tertiary neonatal unit.\n\nPopulation: 36 preterm infants with a median gestation of 30 weeks (range 26-33 weeks) and median birth weight of 1305 g (range 880-1800 g).\n\nMain outcome measure: Mean daily total intake of vitamin A in each of the first 4 weeks of life.\n\nResults: Despite a policy of introducing intravenous lipid supplemented with fat soluble vitamins on day 2, only four infants (11%) consistently met the recommended daily intake of vitamin A during the first 2 weeks of life. Adequacy of vitamin A intake in the first 2 weeks of life was not predicted by gestation or pattern of feeding.",
        "title_question": "Vitamin A provision for preterm infants: are we meeting current guidelines?",
        "long_answer": "Recommendations for intravenous vitamin A supplementation in parenterally fed preterm infants require revision. Intravenous lipid with added fat soluble vitamins should be started as soon as possible after birth, and consideration given to early oral vitamin A supplementation in those infants tolerant of enteral feeds."

        "text": "Background: Selection of specialist trainees in obstetrics and gynaecology has traditionally been hospital based.\n\nAims: To report the outcomes of a state-wide selection process and suggest possibilities for future trainee selection.\n\nMethods: Applicants were screened for interview using a standardised curriculum vitae (CV) and referee reports, and the highest-ranked applicants were offered an interview. Scores from CV, interview and references were collated to give an overall score for each candidate. The candidates were then ranked in order of merit and integrated training program (ITP) hospitals ranked their preferences for candidates. The candidates were then offered positions based on a preference-matching system. Scores for selection components were correlated. Selection matching and trainee retention rates are reported.\n\nResults: In a 4 year period, 155 unique applicants made 183 applications, 65% were interviewed and 43% offered a position; 76% of the successful candidates were preference matched to theirs and the ITP's first choice. The retention rate to date is 92%.",
        "title_question": "Selecting the future in obstetrics and gynaecology: are we stuck in the past?",
        "long_answer": "A state-wide selection process offers a transparent and meritorious means of selection of trainees in obstetrics and gynaecology. It has significant advantages over an individual hospital-based selection process for both trainees and hospitals. Outcome data for the optimal trainee to be selected are difficult to define. Reporting and reviewing data with a national selection process are imperative. The current selection process does not address issues that may be important for selection such as manual dexterity or psychological preparedness for the speciality of obstetrics and gynaecology."
