Recently, misuse of propofol has been reported and the associated risk of death have become an issue. Propofol is commonly used during sedative endoscopy; therefore, its safety in high-risk groups must be further investigated. We performed a pilot study of the safety and efficacy of propofol during endoscopy in Korean patients with cirrhosis.\n\nMethods: Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed under sedation with propofol along with careful monitoring in 20 patients with liver cirrhosis and 20 control subjects. The presence or development of hepatic encephalopathy was assessed using the number connection test and neurologic examination.\n\nResults: Neither respiratory depression nor clinically significant hypotension were observed. Immediate postanesthetic recovery at 5 and 10 minutes after the procedure was delayed in the cirrhotic patients compared with the control group; however, at 30 minutes, the postanesthetic recovery was similar in both groups. Baseline psychomotor performance was more impaired in cirrhotic patients, but propofol was not associated with deteriorated psychomotor function even in cirrhotic patients with a minimal hepatic encephalopathy.",

The aim of this study was to verify that hypopituitarism does not develop if the maximum mean dose to pituitary is kept under 15 Gy and to evaluate the influence of maximum distal infundibulum dose on the development of hypopituitarism.\n\nDesign and methods: We followed the incidence of hypopituitarism in 85 patients irradiated with LGK in 1993-2003. The patients were divided in two subgroups: the first subgroup followed prospectively (45 patients), irradiated with a mean dose to pituitary<15 Gy; the second subgroup followed retrospectively 1993-2001 and prospectively 2001-2009 (40 patients), irradiated with a mean dose to pituitary>15 Gy. Serum TSH, free thyroxine, testosterone or 17β-oestradiol, IGF1, prolactin and cortisol levels were evaluated before and every 6 months after LGK irradiation.\n\nResults: Hypopituitarism after LGK irradiation developed only in 1 out of 45 (2.2%) patients irradiated with a mean dose to pituitary<15 Gy, in contrast to 72.5% patients irradiated with a mean dose to pituitary>15 Gy. The radiation dose to the distal infundibulum was found as an independent factor of hypopituitarism with calculated maximum safe dose of 17 Gy.",

In recent years, substantial increases in the coverage of reproductive health services have been achieved, yet absolute levels of coverage remain very low, especially in rural areas. One strategy for increasing use of reproductive health services is deploying community health workers (CHWs) to promote the use of services within the community and at health facilities.\n\nMethods: Using a multilevel model employing data from a cross-sectional survey of 8320 households in 29 provinces of Afghanistan conducted in 2006, this study determines whether presence of a CHW in the community leads to an increase in use of modern contraceptives, skilled antenatal care and skilled birth attendance. This study further examines whether the effect varies by the sex of the CHW.\n\nResults: Results show that presence of a female CHW in the community is associated with higher use of modern contraception, antenatal care services and skilled birth attendants but presence of a male CHW is not.

Bortezomib (BZ) may be more effective at removing long-lived plasma cells compared to standard regimens that modulate alloantibody production by different mechanisms.\n\nMethods: We report a kidney transplant recipient with several episodes of mixed antibody mediated and cellular rejection treated with numerous therapies including BZ. Monitoring included serial measurements of donor specific antibodies (DSA) by Luminex assay and repeated allograft biopsies.\n\nResults: One cycle of BZ was able to reverse humoral rejection and graft dysfunction. DSA levels to multiple donor HLA antigens which were not affected by previous therapies were reduced to undetectable levels post BZ. Abrogation of DSA was only transient.

CST was diagnosed in 35 patients, of whom 34 had D-dimers above the cutoff value (>500 microg/L). From the 308 patients not having CST, D-dimers were elevated in 27. Sensitivity of D-dimers was 97.1%, with a negative predictive value of 99.6%. Specificity was 91.2%, with a positive predictive value of 55.7%. D-dimers were positively correlated with the extent of the thrombosis and negatively correlated with the duration of symptoms (Spearman rank correlation coefficients 0.76, -0.58, respectively).",

The present investigation endeavored to elucidate the effect of femoral head diameter on fretting and corrosion in retrieved head-neck tapers.\n\nMethods: A retrieval analysis of THA prostheses in vivo for a minimum of 1 year was performed. Twenty-three femoral heads of 32-mm diameter were matched with 28-mm heads based on time in vivo and head length (-3 mm to +8 mm). All included implants featured a single taper design from a single manufacturer. Fretting and corrosion damage scoring was performed for each implant under stereomicroscopic visualization.\n\nResults: Head diameter was observed to affect fretting (P = .01), with 32-mm femoral heads exhibiting greater total fretting scores than 28-mm heads. Fretting damage was greatest (P = .01) in the central concentric zone of the femoral head bore tapers, regardless of head diameter, length, or stem offset. No significant effect on total corrosion scores was observed for any head or stem variable. Retrieved implant total corrosion scores were positively correlated (ρ = 0.51, P<.001) with implantation time.",

        "text": "Rationale: Individuals with asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap syndrome (ACOS), have more rapid decline in lung function, more frequent exacerbations, and poorer quality of life than those with asthma or COPD alone. Air pollution exposure is a known risk factor for asthma and COPD; however, its role in ACOS is not as well understood.\n\nObjectives: To determine if individuals with asthma exposed to higher levels of air pollution have an increased risk of ACOS.\n\nMethods: Individuals who resided in Ontario, Canada, aged 18 years or older in 1996 with incident asthma between 1996 and 2009 who participated in the Canadian Community Health Survey were identified and followed until 2014 to determine the development of ACOS. Data on exposures to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) were obtained from fixed monitoring sites. Associations between air pollutants and ACOS were evaluated using Cox regression models.\n\nMeasurements and main results: Of the 6,040 adults with incident asthma who completed the Canadian Community Health Survey, 630 were identified as ACOS cases. Compared with those without ACOS, the ACOS population had later onset of asthma, higher proportion of mortality, and more frequent emergency department visits before COPD diagnosis. The adjusted hazard ratios of ACOS and cumulative exposures to PM2.5 (per 10 μg/m(3)) and O3 (per 10 ppb) were 2.78 (95% confidence interval, 1.62-4.78) and 1.31 (95% confidence interval, 0.71-2.39), respectively.",

        "text": "Objective: To evaluate different techniques and regional approaches for detecting critical reductions in gastrointestinal (GI) perfusion.\n\nDesign: Laboratory, animal, controlled study.\n\nSetting: University animal research laboratory.\n\nSubjects: Thirteen anesthetized, ventilated, juvenile domestic pigs.\n\nInterventions: Dextran was infused into the pericardial sac to achieve cardiac tamponade that reduced cardiac output to 25% of baseline value. Hemodynamics were invasively monitored, and blood gases were sampled in the systemic and portal circulations. Tonometers were placed in the corpus of the stomach and in the jejunum, 50 cm aboral to the ligament of Treitz.\n\nMeasurements and main results: We measured cardiac output, portal venous blood flow, mesenteric oxygen delivery and consumption, systemic and portal venous blood gases and acid-base balance, stomach and jejunal transepithelial potential difference, stomach and jejunal intramucosal pH, arterial plasma concentrations of asymmetric dimethylarginine, and jejunal, intraluminal nitric oxide. One hour of cardiac tamponade decreased mesenteric oxygen delivery and consumption in a linear fashion and resulted in mesenteric acidosis, as evidenced by decreases in pH, standard bicarbonate, oxygen saturation, and PO2 and increases in PCO2. The potential difference in the jejunum decreased earlier than in the stomach, whereas stomach intramucosal pH decreased before jejunal intramucosal pH. Intraluminal nitric oxide in the jejunum was markedly reduced soon after cardiac tamponade. This reduction was accompanied by an increase in arterial plasma concentrations of the endogenous nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine. Investigated variables were unchanged in control animals.",
