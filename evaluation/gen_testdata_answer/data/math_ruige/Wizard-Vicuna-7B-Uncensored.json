        "question": "The rental charge for a car is 34 cents for the first 1/4 mile driven and 6 cents for every 1/5 mile driven over the initial 1/4 mile. If a man paid $1.24 in rental charges, how many miles did he drive?\nLet's think step by step.",
        "answer": "1. Let's start by finding out how much the rental charge would be for the first 1/4 mile. \n2. We know that the rental charge is 34 cents for the first 1/4 mile. Therefore, the cost of the first 1/4 mile would be 34 cents. \n3. Now, we need to find out how many miles the man drove over and above the first 1/4 mile. \n4. We know that the rental charge is 6 cents for every 1/5 mile driven over the initial 1/4 mile. Therefore, the cost of driving 1 mile over and above the first 1/4 mile would be 6 cents. \n5. Let's assume that the man drove x miles over and above the first 1/4 mile. \n6. Therefore, the total cost of driving x miles over and above the first 1/4 mile would be x * 6 cents. \n7. We are given that the man paid $1.24 in rental charges. \n8. Therefore, the total cost of driving x miles over and above the first 1/4 mile would be $1.24. \n9. We can set up the following equation: \n$1.24 = x * 6 \n10. Simplifying the equation: \n$1.24 = 6x \n11. Solving for x: \nx = $1.24 / 6 \nx = 20 cents \nTherefore, the man drove 20 cents worth of miles over and above the first 1/4 mile."

        "question": "10 women can complete a work in 9 days and 10 children take 12 days to complete the work. How many days will 6 women and 7 children take to complete the work?\nLet's think step by step.",
        "answer": "1. We are given that 10 women can complete a work in 9 days.\n2. We are also given that 10 children take 12 days to complete the work.\n3. We need to find out the number of days it would take 6 women and 7 children to complete the work.\n4. We can use the concept of proportion to solve this problem.\n5. Let's find the ratio of the work done by 6 women and 7 children to the work done by 10 women.\n6. The work done by 10 women is 9/10th of the work. So, the work done by 6 women and 7 children is 9/10th of the work multiplied by 6 and 7, which is:\n(9/10) * (6/10) * 6 * 7 = 54\n7. The work done by 10 children is 12/10th of the work. So, the work done by 6 women and 7 children is 12/10th of the work multiplied by 6 and 7, which is:\n(12/10) * (6/10) * 6 * 7 = 96\n8. We want to find the number of days it would take 6 women and 7 children to complete the work.\n9. We can use the concept of proportion again to find the ratio of the work done by 6 women and 7 children to the work done by 10 children.\n10. The work done by 10 children is 12/10th of the work. So, the work done by 6 women and 7 children is 96/10th of the work.\n11. We know that the work done by 10 children is 12 days. So, the work done by 6 women and 7 children is:\n96/10th * 6 * 7/10th * 12 days = 496 days\n12. Since we want to find the number of days it would take 6 women and 7 children to complete the work, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by 6:\n(96/10th) * 6 * 7/10th * 12 days / 6 = 78.33 days\n13. Since we can't have a fraction of a day, we can round it up to the nearest whole number:\n78 days\nTherefore, the number of days it would take 6 women and 7 children to complete the work is 78 days."

        "question": "If two numbers are in the ratio 2:3. If 10 is added to both of the numbers then the ratio becomes 3:4 then find the smallest number?\nLet's think step by step.",
        "answer": "1. Let's start with the ratio 2:3. \n2. If we add 10 to the second number (let's call it \"x\"), the new ratio will be 2:3+10, which simplifies to 20:30. \n3. If we add 10 to the first number (let's call it \"y\"), the new ratio will be 20:30. \n4. To find the smallest number, we need to compare the two ratios. \n5. To do this, we can convert both ratios to fractions and compare the numerators and denominators. \n6. The numerator of the first ratio is 2 and its denominator is 3, so we can write it as 2/3. \n7. The numerator of the second ratio is 20 and its denominator is 30, so we can write it as 20/30. \n8. To compare the two ratios, we can cancel out the common factors (in this case, 2 and 3) and write the simplified fractions as 2/3 and 20/30. \n9. To compare the two fractions, we can see that the numerator of the first fraction is greater than the numerator of the second fraction, but the denominator of the second fraction is greater than the denominator of the first fraction. \n10. Therefore, the second ratio (20:30) is the smaller ratio, and the smaller ratio corresponds to the smaller number. \n11. Therefore, the smallest number is x/y, where x is the second number and y is the first number. \n12. To find x and y, we can substitute 10 for y in the second ratio and solve for x: \nx/y = 20/30 = 2/3 \ny = x/20 = x/3 \nSo the smallest number is x/y, where x = 20 and y = 3.

To count the number of permutations of 5 letters, we can use the formula: n!/(n-r)!, where n is the total number of letters and r is the number of letters that we want to permute. \n5. In this case, n is 5 and r is 5. \n6. Therefore, the number of permutations of the letters in \"ARMOUM\" is: \n5!/(5-5)! = 5! = 120 \n7.

Now, we need to find the greatest value of k for which (25*24*23*...*4*3*2)*100^k is divisible by 25! (i.e., by y).\n6. We can do this by setting up a system of equations. Let's assume that k=m*100, where m is an integer. Then, we can rewrite (25*24*23*...*4*3*2)*100^k as (25*24*23*...*4*3*2)*(100^m).\n7. Now, we need to find the greatest value of m for which (25*24*23*...*4*3*2)*(100^m) is divisible by (25*24*23*...*4*3*2)*(100^k).\n8. We can do this by dividing (25*24*23*...*4*3*2)*(100^m) by (25*24*23*...*4*3*2)*(100^k).\n9. We know that (25*24*23*...*4*3*2)*(100^k) is equal to 25! (i.e., y), so we can write this as 25!/(25*24*23*...*4*3*2)*(100^k).\n10. Now, we can rewrite this as (25!/(25*24*23*...*4*3*2)*(100^k))/(25*24*23*...*4*3*2)*(100^m).\n11. So, we have:\n25!/(25*24*23*...*4*3*2)*(100^k) = (25!/(25*24*23*...*4*3*2)*(100^k))/(25*24*23*...*4*3*2)*(100^m)\n12. Rearranging, we get:\n(25!/(25*24*23*...*4*3*2)*(100^k))/(25*24*23*...*4*3*2)*(100^m) = 1\n13. Solving for k in terms of m, we get:\nk = m * ln(25*24*23*...*4*3*2*100^m/100^k)\n14. This is the greatest value of k for which y is a factor of x.\n15. We can simplify this expression to get:\nk = m * ln(25*24*23*...*4*3*2*100^m/100^k) - ln(100^k/100^m)\n16. We want to find the greatest value of k for which this expression is positive, i.e., for which k > m *"

        "answer": "1. There are a total of 8 chips in the box, 4 red and 4 blue.\n2. To select two chips without replacement, we can choose any two chips from the total 8 chips.\n3. The first chip can be any of the 4 red chips or any of the 4 blue chips.\n4. Similarly, the second chip can be any of the remaining 3 red chips or any of the remaining 3 blue chips (since we have already selected one).\n5. The probability of selecting a red chip for the first chip is 4/8 or 1/2.\n6. The probability of selecting a blue chip for the first chip is also 4/8 or 1/2.\n7. The probability of selecting a red chip for the second chip is 3/7 or 1/2.\n8. The probability of selecting a blue chip for the second chip is also 3/7 or 1/2.\n9. Since we have already selected one chip, the probability of selecting a red chip for the second chip is the same as the probability of selecting a blue chip for the second chip.\n10. Therefore, the probability of selecting two different colored chips without replacement is:\n(3/7 x 3/6) + (1/2 x 1/2) = 15/31\nSo the probability of selecting two different colored chips without replacement is 15/31."

        "answer": "1. The total quantity of rice lost in grinding is 7%.\n2. When the country has to import 6 million tonnes, 7% of 6 million tonnes is:\n 7% x 6 million = 420,000 tonnes\n3. When only 7 3/4% is lost, 7 3/4% of 6 million tonnes is:\n 7 3/4% x 6 million = 450,000 tonnes\n4. The country can import 3 million tonnes when only 7 3/4% is lost.

There are three blankets purchased @ Rs.100 each = Rs.300.\n4. There are five blankets purchased @ Rs.150 each = Rs.750.\n5. The two blankets purchased at a certain rate are not known.\n6. We cannot find the unknown rate of two blankets without knowing the total cost of all the blankets.\n7. So, we need to find the total cost of all the blankets first.\n8. We have Rs.300 + Rs.750 = Rs.1050.\n9. So, the total cost of all the blankets is Rs.1050.\n10. Now, we need to find the unknown rate of two blankets.\n11.

        "answer": "1. We know that the average capacity of the four barrels is 8 gallons. \n2. We also know that the median is 10 gallons. \n3. So, we can write an equation: \n\"The capacity of the smallest barrel is Q.\" \n4. We also know that Q is less than or equal to the average capacity of the barrels, which is 8 gallons. \n5. So, we can write another equation: \n\"The capacity of the smallest barrel is less than or equal to 8 gallons.\" \n6. We also know that the median is 10 gallons. \n7. So, we can write another equation: \n\"The capacity of the smallest barrel is greater than 10 gallons.\" \n8. Now, we need to find the value of Q that satisfies all three equations at the same time. \n9. Solving the first two equations, we get: \nQ = 8 - 8 = 0 \nThis is not possible, since we know that the capacity of the smallest barrel cannot be zero. \n10. So, we need to find a different value of Q that satisfies the third equation. \n11. Solving the third equation, we get: \nQ > 10 \nSince the capacity of the smallest barrel cannot be greater than the median, we know that Q cannot be greater than 10. \n12. We can now write another equation: \nQ <= 10 \n13. Solving the second and third equations, we get: \nQ = 8 - 10 = -2 \nThis is not possible, since we know that Q cannot be negative. \n14. So, the maximum possible capacity of the smallest barrel Q is 10 gallons. \nTherefore, the answer is C) 10 gallons."

We know that the speed of the vehicle in the first trip is 1/3 of the speed of the vehicle in the later trip.\n5.

To isolate x, we can use the formula for the exponent of a product: (x^n) * (x^m) = x^(n+m). In this case, we have an x raised to the third power, so we can substitute that into the formula.\n3. Then, we can use this formula to isolate x in the equation.\n4. Next, we can move the constant term 432 to the left side of the equation, so we have: (12)^3 x 6^3 - 432 = y\n5. Now, we can simplify the expression inside the parentheses.\n6. Finally, we can isolate y by dividing both sides by 12.\nSo, the final answer is: y = (12/12)^3 x 6^3 = 6^3 = 216."

How much money does Eliot have in his account right now?\nLet's think step by step.",
        "answer": "1. Let's assume that Al currently has $100 in his account and Eliot currently has $x.\n2. Al's account increases by 10%, which means his account now has $110.\n3. The difference between Al's account and Eliot's account is 1/10 of the sum of their two accounts, which is 1/10 of ($100 + $x).\n4. This means that the difference between Al's account and Eliot's account is now $10, which is 1/10 of ($110 + $x).\n5. So the new difference between Al's account and Eliot's account is $10.\n6. When Eliot's account increases by 20%, his account now has $120.\n7. The difference between Al's account and Eliot's account is still $10.\n8. This means that the new difference between Al's account and Eliot's account is $10.\n9. So, Al's account now has $110, and Eliot's account now has $120.\n10. We know that Al's account increased by 10%, which means he now has $110.\n11. So, $110 - $100 = $10.\n12. Therefore, Eliot currently has $100 in his account."

        "answer": "1. The first prime number is 2.\n2. The second prime number is 3.\n3. The third prime number is 5.\n4. The fourth prime number is 7.\n5. To find the multiplication of the first three prime numbers, we simply multiply them together: 2 x 3 x 5 = 30.\n6. To find the multiplication of the last three prime numbers, we add the first three prime numbers together and then subtract one: 30 + 3 x 5 = 30 + 15 = 45.\n7. Then, we subtract 2 from 45 to get 43.\n8. Finally, we subtract 1 from 43 to get the last prime number, which is 42.\nTherefore, the last prime number is 42."
